      Gaming has always been a pretty big part of my life. It has been part of my life since I got my very first gaming system in 2005, a GameBoy Advanced. As you can see in the picture on the right a lot of time has passed and gaming has exploded in my life. But this all really started when our family got a "State of the art Desktop" around 2008, and since then I have been hooked. Starting at such a young age on the computer I feel has put me in the spot I am today. Without starting so early I would have never been so interested in them not and also it made me just more tech savvy than the average person.
