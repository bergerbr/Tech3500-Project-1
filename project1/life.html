      <p>
          So as mentioned before my name is Bryce Berger, I am a Senior at Kean University planning on
          graduating this year in 2022. Throughout my 4 years here at Kean I was introduced into the 
          Cyber-security world. I have always been interested in computers from what I can remember in my early life. While also being involved in computers I loved sports and still do to this day as I play Lacrosse here at Kean. I am not the only person in my family to be a part of Kean also, the picture to the right is my younger brother and I. This year he is a freshman here at Kean. We both grew up in a little town in South Jersey right on the Delaware river since we can both remember. It has always been a big part of our lives to be the first in our family to graduate from college and well we are both making it happenen!
